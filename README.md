# D3-Challenge

This challenge uses the D3 javascript library to make custom scatter plots of census data. Event listeners change the axes when clicked, and With d3-tip, show specific information about each datapoint on mouseover. The code is arranged by function, combining x-axis and y-axis operations whenever possible.
